# Food-Bank-Application

Worked in a team of 4 to develop a food bank app that constructed a food hamper with stocked items based on
family size and age to meet their weekly caloric needs. Integrated a graphical user interface which allowed users to input their dietary restrictions to customize their
hamper based on their needs and generated a receipt for them to preview. Processed and imported data using an SQL database which was regularly updated after each hamper request to notify future clients about availability of the items in inventory
